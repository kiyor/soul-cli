# soul-cli

A soul-aware launcher for [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code). It gives your AI a persistent identity, memory, and the ability to evolve across sessions.

Claude Code starts fresh every time — no memory, no personality, no idea who you are. **soul-cli** fixes this by assembling markdown files (identity, personality, memory, skills) into a system prompt injected at launch.

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kiyor/soul-cli.git && cd soul-cli
go build -ldflags "-X main.defaultAppName=myai" -o myai .
mv myai ~/go/bin/

myai init                          # interactive wizard
myai init --archetype companion    # pick a personality archetype
myai                               # Claude Code, but it remembers
```

The `init` command creates your workspace, generates soul files, and installs a setup-guide skill — no manual file editing needed.

### Personality Archetypes

| Archetype | Vibe |
|-----------|------|
| `companion` | Emotionally present partner — remembers the small things, picks up on mood |
| `engineer` | Technical peer — code first, explain later, dry humor |
| `steward` | Operations manager — proactive, organized, quietly reliable |
| `mentor` | Patient teacher — Socratic questions, layered explanations |
| *(custom)* | Define your own from keywords |

On first launch, the AI automatically enriches its personality based on your conversation (day-0 self-enrichment).

### AI-Friendly (No Stdin Required)

```bash
myai init --archetype engineer --name kuro --owner alex --tz America/Los_Angeles
```

All flags provided = zero interactive prompts. Perfect for scripting or AI-driven setup.

> **Requires:** Go 1.25+ and [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code)

### One-Command Linux Deploy

Don't want to set up manually? Feed the bootstrap guide to Claude Code and let it do everything:

```bash
export CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN="sk-ant-oat01-..."  # your OAuth token first
claude -p "$(curl -sfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kiyor/soul-cli/main/bootstrap.md)"
```

It'll ask you a few questions (AI name, personality, timezone), then handle Go, Node.js, build, systemd — everything. It even scans your existing Claude Code sessions to personalize the soul.

See [Linux Server Deployment Guide](docs/guides/linux-deploy.md) if you prefer doing it yourself.

## How It Works

```
Soul Files + Memory + Skills  →  soul-cli  →  Claude Code (with soul)
     (markdown)                  (assembles)    (--append-system-prompt)
```

- **`SOUL.md`** — personality, values, speaking style
- **`USER.md`** — your timezone, preferences, expertise
- **`MEMORY.md`** + daily notes — what happened yesterday, long-term knowledge
- **`AGENTS.md`** — behavioral rules and guardrails

The binary name determines identity: build as `myai`, `jarvis`, or `atlas` — all paths, env vars, and logs derive from it.

## Features

| Feature | How |
|---------|-----|
| **Memory** | Daily notes auto-generated from sessions, long-term topics, SQLite session DB |
| **Evolution** | `--evolve` cron reviews interactions and self-adjusts soul files |
| **Server mode** | Built-in HTTP server + Web UI for persistent sessions |
| **Automation** | `--cron` (memory), `--heartbeat` (health checks), `--evolve` (self-improvement) |
| **Multi-agent** | One codebase, multiple binaries with isolated data |
| **Safety** | Symlink rejection, secret leak detection, CORE.md protection, auto-rollback |
| **Telegram** | Notifications, reports, conversation context injection |

## Usage

```bash
myai                         # interactive session
myai -p "check disk usage"   # one-shot task
myai -r                      # resume previous session
myai server --token secret   # HTTP server + Web UI
myai --cron                  # memory consolidation
myai --heartbeat             # health check patrol
myai --evolve                # self-improvement
myai status                  # quick diagnostics
```
